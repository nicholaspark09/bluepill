# BluePill
This is a library to help developers quickly create Debug menus

## QuickStart
To use the library, in your application class please call
    `BluePillLibrary.initialize({YourOwnImplementationOfMenuProvider})`

You need to provide your own implemenation of MenuProvider which is where
you can store and persist the debug values


## Notes
This library is still a work in progress. I plan on releasing the library via
Jitpack in the near future.
